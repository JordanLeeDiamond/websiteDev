                            JDM stands for Japanese Domestic Market.
                            <br>
                            JDM refers to any vehicle that was produced for the Japanese domestic vehicle market
                            <br>
                            However, JDM can also be mean a car simply made by a Japanese manufacturer.
                            <br>
                            There are many conflicting opinions about the true meaning of JDM but at the end of the day, it is more than just an acronym.
