                                The AE86 Trueno. 
                                <br>
                                Manufactured from 1984-1987 this vehicle had such a short manufacturing run but such a huge impact. 
                                <br>
                                This vehicle was the star of the anime ‘Initial D’.
                                <br>
                                Driven by the main protagonist Takumi, this anime introduced drifting and JDM culture to millions around the world.
                                <br>
                                To this day there are still people discovering Initial D and finding a newfound love for the JDM culture. 
                                <br>
                                The AE86 is a variant of the Toyota Corolla, it is. Small front-engine / rear-wheel-drive vehicle.
                                <br>
                                Very much like the Civic this car was obtainable and being able to drive a car that a hero of your favorite anime drove,
                                <br>
                                give’s you the feeling that you could drive flat out down Mount Akina drifting around the blind turns 
                                <br>
                                in the middle of the night whilst you are racing much more powerful machines and somehow winning.
