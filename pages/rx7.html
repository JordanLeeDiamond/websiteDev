                                The Mazda RX7 or the Mazda Rotary Experiment #7. 
                                <br>
                                The RX7 was manufactured between 1992 - 2002.
                                <br>
                                The USP that the RX7 has over all the other JDM legends is that it is fitted with a Rotary Engine.
                                <br>
                                Along with the innovative Rotary Engine, 
                                <br>
                                this generation of the RX7 was fitted with a very technically advanced Sequential Twin Turbo Charger.
                                <br>
                                This combination allows this machine to make 238bhp and a 0-60 time of 5.2 seconds. 
                                <br>
                                You cannot think about the RX7 without also thinking about a Veilside body kit.
                                <br>
                                The Veilside RX7 is arguably more iconic than the base Mosel RX7 FD. 
                                <br>
                                It transforms the car to look unrecognizable and something that should have been released in 2021, not 1992.
