                                The Nissan Skyline R34 GTR or better known as Godzilla.
                                <br>
                                This engineering masterpiece was originally manufactured from 1998 - 2002.
                                <br>
                                A technologically advanced display unit set the model apart from other JDM cars, 
                                <br>
                                while its RB26 twin-turbo engine produced an impressive 320 horsepower.
                                <br>
                                The body was also stiffer, the aerodynamics were improved, and several weight-saving measures were employed, 
                                <br>
                                including the use of a carbon fiber rear diffuser.
                                <br>
                                Most notably the R34 GTR appeared in several of the “Fast and Furious” movies.
                                <br>
                                However, none were as impactful as its appearance in 2 Fast 2 Furious.
                                <br>
                                Watching Paul Walker's character Brian race through the streets of Miami in his Silver and Blue livery R34 gave everyone around the world a taste of true Japanese performance.
                                <br>
                                From this day on the dream to own one of these legendary cars was cemented in countless fan's minds.
                                <br>
                                This car alone will go down as the Godfather of all JDM legends.
