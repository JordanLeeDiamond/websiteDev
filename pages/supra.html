                                The Toyota Supra MK4 or also knows as the “10-second car”.
                                <br>
                                This masterpiece of Japanese engineering was originally manufactured from 1993 - 2002. 
                                <br>
                                With the fourth-generation redesign,
                                <br>
                                Toyota placed a great emphasis on a more serious high-performance car. 
                                <br>
                                Being fitted with a twin-turbocharged 2JZ engine from the factory this JDM rocket could accelerate from 0-60 in 4.6 seconds. 
                                <br>
                                This icon was the face of the original Fast and Furious movie released in 2001. 
                                <br>
                                Watching the car turn up on the back of a tow truck from a scrap yard and being transformed into a street racing titan. 
                                <br>
                                This got every JDM fan’s heart racing at the thought of “overnighting” some parts from Japan for their own 2JZ monster.
